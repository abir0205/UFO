# UFOs

## Overview of Project


We developed an HTML file that allows users to search for UFO sightings from various locations throughout the United States. Users were able to filter this data by narrowing their search by date, city, state, country, and the shape of the UFO. Furthermore, this project was designed to teach the student on how to make HTML pages that interact with Javascript files to optimize data analysis.

## Results

Upon opening the HTML file, users first see a summary overview of UFOs. By scrolling down, they can then see a full list of UFO sightings on a table on the righthand side of the page. This table contains all the UFO sightings contained in the data file. If the user would like to filter the table based on ate, city, state, country, or the shape of the UFO, they can use the respective filters found to the left of the table.

## Summary

A significant drawback of this design is the limited data that can be accessed. We are limited to the number of UFO sightings found in this data.js file when there are possibly many more. This can be ameliorated if a future project was able to continually pull data of UFO sightings from the internet to constantly update the table to make sure we have the most recent information. Furthermore, we do not know whether this information is accurate. To ameliorate this, we can add a filter to only display verified data.
